  <h1>There's a lot to learn if you're trying to learn how to play or watch
     League of Legends. Let's break it down.</h1>
  <h2>Roles:</h2>
  <p>There are 5 roles in League of Legends. Take a quick look at the map
     <em>Summoner's Rift</em> in
    League of Legends so you can better understand where each role goes.
    <a href="https://sfitzsimmons.github.io/week02/index.html">
      <strong>"Map of Summoner's Rift"</strong></a> Each
    role has strengths and
    weaknesses. I will list them below.</p>
    <h3>Top lane</h3>
      <p> The top laner the champion that earns its gold and experience by
         farming the enemy minions that come marching down the top lane. Top
          lane is the most independent role in the game. For the most part,
           you're on your own. Top laners usually take the <em>Teleport</em>
            summoner spell so they can join a teamfight on the other side of
             the map. Typically, top laners choose champions with good sustain
              so they can remain in the top lane without having to recall for
               extended periods of time.</p>
      <p>Strengths:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Because the top laner is alone in the top lane, they doesn't have
           to share any of their gold or experience. This means they can
            easily become the highest level champion on the team.</li>
        <li>Top laners usually have pretty linear scaling so they're strong
           early, mid, and late game.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Weaknesses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The top and bot lanes are long lanes and unlike the bot laner, the
           top laner is alone in its long lane. It's dangerous to be alone in
            a long lane so top laners are highly susceptible to ganks by the
             enemy jungler.</li>
        <li>Top laners can get counter-picked. There are certain champion
           matchups that favor one champion in lane. This means the top laner
            can be zoned off their minions or risk being
             <strong>killed</strong> in an <em>all in.</em></li>
        <li>While top laners can safely collect all the experience available
           to them, it isn't as easy for them to collect all the gold from the
            minions due their lack of ranged waveclear.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Jungle</h3>
      <p>The jungler is the champion that earns its gold and experience by
         clearing the neutral jungle camps that spawn in the jungle between
          lanes. The jungler is the brains behind the operation. They have the
           most decision making to do. While laners are focused on their lanes,
            the jungler is deciding when and where to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Clear their jungle camps.</li>
    <li><em>Counter jungle</em> the enemy jungle camps.</li>
    <li><em>Gank</em> enemy laners.</li>
    <li>Take objectives such as the <strong>Dragon, Rift Herald,
      Baron Nashor,</strong> or enemy structures. </li>
    <li>Getting vision down to track the enemy jungler.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Strengths:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clearing the jungle is safer than laning because jungle camps always
       do the same thing and there are no enemy champions nearby.</li>
    <li>The jungler spends most of their time in the enemy's
      <em>fog of war.</em> This gives them the element of surprise when they
       show up turning a losing 1v1 into a winning 2v1.</li>
    <li>Junglers take the summoner spell <em>Smite</em> which deals a large
       amount of true damage to minions or monsters. This makes it so they can
        nearly guarantee the last hit on monsters so they aren't stolen by the
         enemy team. They can also use smite to steal monsters from the enemy
          team in a <em>smite-off</em>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Weaknesses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Junglers take more blame from their teammates than any other role when
       things go wrong.</li>
    <li>It's both a blessing and a curse how influential a jungler's decisions
       are. Poor decisions can be hugely costly. Failing a <em>gank</em> can
        turn a winning lane into a losing lane.</li>
  </ul>
    <h3>Mid lane</h3>
      <p>Similarly to the top laner, the mid laner is the champion that earns
         its gold and experience by farming the enemy minions that march down
          the mid lane. The mid lane is the shortest lane in the game. This
           also makes it the safest lane because the mid laner never has to
            venture far from the saftey of their tower. Mid laners are
             typically powerful champions with good ranged waveclear. They
              clear their minion wave and then have time to leave their lane
               and return before their tower is in danger.</p>
  <p>Strengths:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mid laners earn just as much experience as the top laner and as much
       gold as the bot laner.</li>
    <li>Because they're in the middle of the map, after pushing their wave, the
       mid laner can roam anywhere else on the map.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Weaknesses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The enemy mid tower is the hardest tower to take because it is the
       heaviestly defended tower.</li>
    <li>The mid laner is a solo laner and as such is vulnerable to
       being 1v2'd.</li>
  </ul>
    <h3>Bot lane</h3>
      <p>The bot laner is the champion that earns its gold and experience by
         farming the enemy minions that come marching down the bot lane. The
          bot laner is different than the top and mid laners in that it isn't
           alone in the bot lane. The bot lane is a duo lane which is occupied
            by both the bot laner and their support. While the bot laner gets
             all the gold from farming the minions, it splits the experience
              earned by the minions with their support.</p>
  <p>Strengths:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The bot laner has a support that is there to keep them safe while they
       <em>last-hit</em> every minion. Because of this, the bot laner should
        earn the most gold on the team.</li>
    <li>Bot laners scale with items better than any champion in the game. This
       means they become the strongest member of the team come
        <strong>lategame.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Weaknesses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Because bot laners scale so well with items, they're really weak until
       they have items. That's why they're the ones with the support. The
        support is to cover their earlygame weakness.</li>
    <li>The bot laner shares their minion experience with their support. This
       means the bot laner and the support are the lowest leveled champions in
        the game and often times the squishiest.</li>
  </ul>
    <h3>Support</h3>
      <p>The support is the other champion that earns its gold and experience
         in the bot lane, but it doesn't earn gold by killing minions - the
          minion gold in the bot lane goes to the bot laner but the experience
           from the minions is split between the two. So where does the
            support get gold from? Well supports get to start the game with a
             special class of starting item from the item shop that is only
              viable on supports. This is called a support item and they have
               1 of 2 passives that allow them to earn gold: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tribute: Damaging spells and attacks against champions or buildings
       grant 15 gold. This can occur up to 3 times every 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Spoils of War: While nearby an ally, basic attacks execute minions
       below 50% of their max Health (30% for ranged) and grants them kill
        gold. (These effects recharge every 45 seconds. Max 3 charges.)</li>
    </ul>
  <p>The support's purpose is to keep their bot laner safe throughout the early
     game. They're also tasked with vision control along with the jungler.
      They're always expected to have wards on hand.</p>
    <p>Strengths:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Freedom. The support doesn't have to last hit minions so they can put
       their focus on other things. So long as their bot laner is safe, they
        can focus on damaging enemy champions, getting vision down, roam mid
         lane, or group up with their jungler to make a play.</li>
    <li>The support can be a playmaker. Supports are usually champions that
       don't need items to be effective. Their kits bring utility or crowd
        control to their team.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Weaknesses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The support is the poorest champion in the game. There aren't any
       minions or jungle monsters for them to last hit.</li>
    <li>The support is the lowest leveled champion in the game. They share
       experience with their bot laner, but they often times miss experience
        when they leave the lane.</li>
  </ul>
